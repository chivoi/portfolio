### **Components**
* The common _**navigation bar**_ is present on all the pages, and consists of 2 x parts: links to social media, as well as the main menu. The main menu collapses into a hamburger menu icon and a drop down menu on smaller screens. 
* Common components also include _**footer**_ with the copyright statement. 
* Most of the pages include a component of _**"quick link"**_ buttons, leading the viewer to the contact or project pages where appropriate.
* Graphic content is represented by the _**icons**_ (socials icons in the navbar, tech icons on the resume and project pages) and _**images**_ (on the About page, Projects, Blog, Blog posts).
* Projects and Blog pages have a common theme of _**"preview cards"**_, the separate box that includes images, text, header, links.
* Blog post pages share a component of a _**blog navbar**_, which includes left and right arrows and "back to blog" button.

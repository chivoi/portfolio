          <p>I work as a Software Engineer at Zendesk. It's a full stack job with a backend focus, using Ruby on Rails, Node / Typescript, some React and some Go.</p>
          <p>Apart from my regular work, I'm a big fan of extracurricular activities, such as code club and book club at work, where I have fun connecting with people outside my team and trying out new challenges.</p>
          <p>Before getting into tech, I used to be a singing teacher by day and a hotel worker by night. I also make music with an alternative fusion band <a target="blank" href="https://www.renelophus.com"><strong>Renelophus</strong></a>.</p>
          <p>I am a big DEI advocate, passionate about bringing positive change to the future and increasing diversity and inclusivity in tech. To promote this and give back to my community, I volunteer as a site council representative at Zendesk ANZ site council. This role gives me an opportunity to organize exciting events, drive initiatives that help employees from various underrepresented groups, assist my colleagues with getting educated on minority issues, connect with folks in a wider community. I really like to create nurturing environments around me and improve any workplace I join.</p>
          <p>In my free time I like to cook, hang out with my cat Borsch, make music or paint miniatures. When the weather is nice, I like to get out of town for a hike.</p>
          <p>If you would like to connect, work together or just say hi, feel free to get in touch with me on LinkedIn.</p></div>
